00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:08.829
Kaylee Swenson: Okay? first, I would love if you would both state your name and your positions within the Faa.

2
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.329
Brian Rushforth: So I'm Brian. Rush forth. I'm the manager of the Innovation Division which is in the Strategic

3
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.960
Management Directorate of the Commercial Space Transportation Line of business of the Federal aviation administration.

4
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:36.009
Brian Verna: I'm Brian Verna. I'm a senior adviser to the Chief of staff of the office of Commercial Space Transportation at the Faa.

5
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:51.649
Kaylee Swenson: All right. So my research, as you probably gathered through my emails, is primarily concerned with public opinion and the interaction between public opinion and these agencies. Specifically, agencies who deal with more of like space.

6
00:00:51.700 --> 00:01:10.110
Kaylee Swenson: It's easy for public opinion to be formed about like the post office, because they see someone who delivers their mail every day. But these agencies that are dealing with these kinds of concepts that the average public will never likely interact with. I think it's an interesting phenomenon to see how they engage public opinion

7
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:22.890
Kaylee Swenson: and how they do so intentionally, or how they view public opinion as influencing what they do. because at the end of the day. It's still a democracy, and you're still working for the government. So I think that there's

8
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.610
Kaylee Swenson: There's a phenomenon there that I don't think people

9
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:49.179
Kaylee Swenson: take very seriously. But I feel like there's definitely something interesting there. So a lot of these questions are going to be about pog opinion. you just answer them from your perspective. It's okay. If there's not super obvious, clear answers, since I know neither of you are like, that's your main focus is public opinion in the agency. So just, whatever you have for me will still be greatly appreciated and very useful.

10
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.030
Kaylee Swenson: so how do you feel like public opinion

11
00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.290
Kaylee Swenson: could be characterized about your department. So how does the public feel about your department?

12
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:10.620
Brian Rushforth:  I say, to a great extent. if you go to the public.

13
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.090
Brian Rushforth: And you talk about space

14
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:20.529
Brian Rushforth: the first thing they think of as NASA And there is a very positive NASA has a very positive.

15
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.880
Brian Rushforth: I'm gonna pull out my Mba stuff. And you know they are huge brand equity

16
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.280
Brian Rushforth: for space. I mean, NASA owns the space brand equity

17
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:40.549
Brian Rushforth: and it's and it's very positive for the most part, right? I mean, you know, it's who doesn't like watching the launch, you know, or watching.

18
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:47.460
Brian Rushforth: you know, pictures of outer space, or, you know, dating myself, Carl Sagan. And you know.

19
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.920
Brian Rushforth: you know Neil de Gross Tyson nowadays, and all that other kind of stuff. So

20
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.410
Brian Rushforth: we start from a place that is pretty

21
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.110
Brian Rushforth: positive in the public side.

22
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:09.010
Brian Rushforth: we are a small organization, and I think people just aren't as aware.

23
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.610
Brian Rushforth: you know we do. We have had, media can social media outreach and that kind of stuff

24
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.389
Brian Rushforth:  and doing, you know, commercial space. But I think a lot of

25
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.710
Brian Rushforth: you know, a lot of people don't really associate commercial space. And, Faa.

26
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:38.610
Brian Rushforth: they'll associate NASA and Spacex not the least, because guess what Spacex and Blue and Ula all have contracts with NASA for so you know, it reinforces.

27
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:47.179
Brian Rushforth: You know, most most people are not paying rapt attention to the inner workings of a very small organization

28
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.170
Brian Rushforth: that, nevertheless has a huge authority.

29
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.519
Brian Rushforth: when it comes to the licensing of launches and re-entries for commercial space operations.

30
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.319
Kaylee Swenson: Yeah, Mr. Vernon, do you have anything to add to that?

31
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.509
Brian Verna: I would. I would say, we don't

32
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.910
Brian Verna: overall. I agree with it.

33
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:23.879
Brian Verna: You're you're kind of distant. Oh, you can't here. Oh, that's much better. Okay, so I was, gonna say, I agree with pretty much everything you said, Brian and I just want to add the bit about

34
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.080
Brian Verna: where we get our authority from.

35
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:33.760
Brian Verna: and it's from our legislative counterparts. So those are people that are put into position.

36
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:49.970
Brian Verna: So to manage government basically managed an executive branch which we we work for. So so the public is involved at that angle their constituents are represented through those representatives that right the off, the the legislation that gives us

37
00:04:50.420 --> 00:05:00.689
Brian Verna: our legal authority to do things. So that's another aspect. That's the legal aspect that's in influenced by public opinion to some degree.

38
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:12.839
Kaylee Swenson: Yeah, I definitely agree. And that actually brings me to one of the questions that I was, gonna ask later, but this is perfect time for it. So with that authority coming from the legislative branch.

39
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Kaylee Swenson: do you feel like

40
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.979
Kaylee Swenson: engaging public opinion in a positive way, can connect to

41
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.660
Kaylee Swenson: stability of Congressional funding

42
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:31.899
Kaylee Swenson: like, do you see a connection there between keeping positive public opinion and keeping Congress happy? Essentially

43
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.389
Brian Rushforth: because what happens when the public is not happy, and by public I mean not just.

44
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.360
Brian Rushforth: You know, John and Jane DOE. And you know. Missoula.

45
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.600
Brian Rushforth: the public includes the Ceos

46
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.419
Brian Rushforth: of every launch and

47
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.190
Brian Rushforth: re-entry applicants and operator.

48
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:59.969
Brian Rushforth: The public is. you know, the people that talk to reporters who then publish stories

49
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.820
Brian Rushforth: who complain to and write letters to Congress.

50
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.080
Brian Rushforth: so there is a direct

51
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:15.879
Brian Rushforth:  correlation or not correlation. There's a direct line between

52
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.210
Brian Rushforth:  Congressional interest and

53
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:42.479
Brian Rushforth: not so much to find that we haven't really been threatened with funding because of public opinion. In fact, we've been gained a lot of money, because well, again, I guess from public opinion, like launch operators and others. we we need. We've needed more people and resources. And Congress has been providing that. So we can actually keep up

54
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.610
with the pace of new entrance and and an increased

55
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.440
Brian Rushforth: operational cadences of the spacexes blues

56
00:06:52.770 --> 00:07:00.419
Brian Rushforth: versions, and and the others that are coming that are all new and coming in. you know. So look, we don't.

57
00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.319
Brian Rushforth: You know the faa tends to be

58
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:13.090
relatively static, I mean Faa is is in many fortunate ways, no one. There's no partisanship against

59
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.439
Brian Rushforth: aviation, safety, and aerospace safety.

60
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:27.979
Brian Rushforth: There's no one to say. You know what we don't need safe planes. We don't need safe airports. We can let people just die. Nobody says that, no matter what end of the aisle you're on.

61
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:36.820
Brian Rushforth: And so we're relatively stable compared to say other areas like, if you're

62
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:41.260
Brian Rushforth: you know the EPA or your the

63
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:49.019
Brian Rushforth: you know, parts of the Justice Department, or whatever is, is involving a partisan

64
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:58.669
Brian Rushforth:  difference. So we tend to be fairly stable in that regard. Now, Congress with. If everything is going fine.

65
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:10.780
Brian Rushforth: Congress generally doesn't take an interest or or they're they're taking an interest in terms of you know, helping out from an economic perspective, or if they have a space port in their particular district or state

66
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:16.710
Brian Rushforth: and there's a lot of interest in that, because that means jobs and all that kind of stuff.

67
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:27.690
Brian Rushforth: but the negative interest can also have an effect as well. We hear about that. we hear either directly from the public, because we have.

68
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.799
Brian Rushforth: we have not only from a safety perspective.

69
00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:39.549
Brian Rushforth: We have a mechanisms like the administrative hotline that people can call in an anonymously

70
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:54.790
Brian Rushforth: leave tips or allegations that we investigate, or on some kind of safety related. item, there's the Ig for waste, fraud and abuse but there's also the big, probably the biggest

71
00:08:55.070 --> 00:09:02.040
Brian Rushforth: place the public plays is in the Nepa process.

72
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:25.179
Brian Rushforth: So that so when you're talking launches, or you're talking a new space port, or you're talking something. Operations happening where they haven't happened before. there's a Nepa process that by law, we have to do certain outreach. they launch. The applicant has to do certain outreach where there's a space board or a or a launch operator

73
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.910
Brian Rushforth: and the and the public has an opportunity to weigh in

74
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:49.170
Brian Rushforth: and comment on all of those. And if there, if the public is not satisfied with our decisions. They they complain to Congress, they file lawsuits. you know they. They use the the levers and the mechanisms of government that are available to the public to attempt to address the agreements.

75
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.979
Kaylee Swenson: Okay? And would you say that

76
00:09:54.430 --> 00:10:07.070
Kaylee Swenson: obviously there are places where you are required to let the public have input, would you say that input does ultimately impact the agencies, either priorities or even their ultimate actions that they take?

77
00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:14.709
Brian Rushforth: Well, I mean, we. So we follow the process. So yeah, if there's if there's inputs

78
00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:31.750
Brian Rushforth: you know, if there's allegations, if there's, you know, we have to respond to the comments and not I. I forgot the main. You know thing, we're a regulator. And so we put out rule making and advisory circular. That's another area

79
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:43.239
Brian Rushforth: that. The public has, an opportunity to provide input on. So like our most recent regional part 4 50, which was a a massive rewrite

80
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:49.329
Brian Rushforth: of 4 former far parts on on launches

81
00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:54.930
Brian Rushforth: launch operations that we consolidated into one rag

82
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.280
Brian Rushforth: So

83
00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.119
Brian Rushforth: rings are a massive opportunity

84
00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:22.200
Brian Rushforth: to provide input whether you're again John or Jane Q. Public, whether you are a actual operator in the industry, whether you are a lobbyist, whether you are a nonprofit group that's associated with say, environmental concerns. Everyone has an opportunity to provide input on those. do we

85
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:25.359
Brian Rushforth: change priorities?

86
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:46.789
Brian Rushforth: I'm not sure. I'm not sure that's quite. We don't change priorities per say, if there was anything we would change, it would be changing whether or not I mean all these comments and everything aren't so much in terms of the prioritization of, say, we're taking on Spacex or looking at super heavy or looking at starship, or.

87
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:54.039
Brian Rushforth: you know, blue or whatever it's more for that particular decision.

88
00:11:54.260 --> 00:12:02.330
Brian Rushforth:  on on how we I issue a a license, or need a determination, or

89
00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:06.950
any any of those they they tend to be more on the

90
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:13.630
Brian Rushforth: for lack of a better term, tactical individual actions that we take.

91
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.010
Brian Rushforth: we have

92
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:28.269
Brian Rushforth: as part of. I guess this would be considered public to, because it's not part of the faa we do have, what's called The Faa has advisory councils

93
00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:35.010
Brian Rushforth: made up of representatives of of various areas of industry.

94
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:39.159
and we have one for commercial space

95
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:53.900
Brian Rushforth: called the commercial space, Transportation and Advisory Council. Come, stack and there is a whole set of statute around. How you do that, how it works.

96
00:12:53.900 --> 00:13:11.069
Brian Rushforth: transparency. You know all the rules around how how to how to run, and those those councils are, in fact. you know we do. We do take them very seriously, and they will provide

97
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:15.659
Brian Rushforth: well based their advisory right? We'll ask them questions. What do you think of X,

98
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:20.469
or we have these kind of situations coming up in the future.

99
00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.830
Brian Rushforth: What! What's your opinion on how we should attempt to meet them? Meet these challenges.

100
00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:33.979
Brian Rushforth: and so they will provide a set of formalized recommendations. that that we we may or may not take.

101
00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:48.960
Brian Rushforth: but they are an opportunity. probably the Advisory Councils are the biggest public ones. And of course, if there's. you know, with you, and cry from the public on something that it filters through Congress and the White House and

102
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:55.130
Brian Rushforth: all that, then that can lead to action to. So I don't know if that answers the question, but it's sort of the

103
00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:00.970
Brian Rushforth: we're we're not the whim of public opinion per se.

104
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:05.380
Brian Rushforth: But we do. We do clearly have defined

105
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:14.109
Brian Rushforth: areas and opportunities for a variety of stakeholders to provide. Input.

106
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:18.390
Brian Verna: Yeah, thank you.

107
00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:22.869
Brian Verna: just clarify the Nep as the National Environmental Policy Act.

108
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:31.970
Brian Verna: And that's implemented by the Council on environmental quality. So just like us. They have, no authority to set regulations

109
00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:37.790
Brian Verna: So we have to comply with those regulations. And those are environmental focused. And so what Brian was saying is.

110
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:49.569
Brian Verna: we provide a draft programmatic environmental assessment of the impact to this area that has a launch or re-entry. And we engage with this local folks to

111
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.250
Brian Verna: to get their input on it.

112
00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.700
Brian Verna: but that's

113
00:14:54.010 --> 00:15:03.000
Brian Verna: based on someone else's regulations. And then Brian touched on our own regulations, which we can set through our legislative authorities which we talked about.

114
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:07.430
Brian Verna: But we have to follow the Administrative Procedures Act which

115
00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.940
Brian Verna: governs public notice

116
00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:14.709
Brian Verna: input and comment. one of the things I will note

117
00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:16.390
Brian Verna: you.

118
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:25.550
Brian Verna: We take seriously all comments. and we address all comments through these role, making actions where we set our rules. but

119
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:34.899
Brian Verna: the ones that will tip the scale if you will or have the most impact is one that is data driven. one that is based on

120
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:42.959
Brian Verna: on on data. what? What we've seen a lot of, you know the high profile cases. You'll get a lot of people commenting, oh.

121
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:50.569
Brian Verna: this export of that, or what you know, things like that that doesn't really do. You can have all the emotion and feeling you want.

122
00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:58.160
Brian Verna: But you need to sit down and actually think about what you want to put in. So so we do take all comments seriously. But we do.

123
00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.349
Brian Verna: makes some changes based on

124
00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.150
Brian Verna: actual data. So

125
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:17.350
Brian Verna: if you're like as a launch provider that's got real skin in the game and provide actual information. And we will consider that heavily. But if you're just making a comment, saying, I don't agree with that.

126
00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:18.500
Brian Verna: Well.

127
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.780
Brian Verna: thanks.

128
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.670
Brian Verna: We have one comment comment, or to sent it. Okay.

129
00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:29.270
Brian Verna: so. And the other is is other political. I mean, we're we're

130
00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:34.690
Brian Rushforth: our authority for and in our rules that we use to evaluate

131
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:41.820
Brian Rushforth: and our internal processes we use to evaluate.  You know. For example, we we get a lot of

132
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.990
It's come up every couple of years. The Turks that

133
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.530
Brian Rushforth: satellite launch. Well, there's a bunch of

134
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.439
Brian Rushforth: Armenian Associated groups.

135
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:57.420
Brian Rushforth: who Don't want us to approve the license? Well, we don't.

136
00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:01.939
Brian Rushforth: Our. Our. Our authority is is wrapped around

137
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.380
Brian Rushforth: safety to the uninvolved public of the launch operation itself. Not whether or not

138
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:16.650
Brian Rushforth: that payload is politically acceptable to a group.

139
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:23.720
Brian Rushforth: It is we we purely have to evaluate on safety. So yes, they provide input there. And

140
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:25.829
Brian Rushforth: all this other stuff. But it's

141
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:39.200
Brian Rushforth: there's nothing in our regulations about, you know, the political side. That's really not what we do. our job is to make determinations as to whether or not the license is going to be safe for the public or not.

142
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:48.540
Kaylee Swenson: Okay. So both of you have kind of alluded to this idea that there are people who are much more informed than the mass public

143
00:17:48.630 --> 00:18:01.669
Kaylee Swenson: and they still count as like a public opinion. Would you say that that group who's more closer to the issue and more knowledgeable, has a different view of either your department or the Faa than the mass public would.

144
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.930
Brian Rushforth: Yes.

145
00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:07.080
Brian Rushforth: absolutely. Those are your launch operators

146
00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:22.470
Brian Rushforth: intimately familiar with. They're intimately familiar with the regulations they're intimately familiar with how we do business. They're intimately aware of how our decisions can affect

147
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.610
Brian Rushforth: them.

148
00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:35.920
Brian Rushforth:  as well. And also there's other stakeholders that aren't necessarily the public, but that we also respond to which is our intergovernmental partners. you know, Dod.

149
00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:42.209
plays a safety role as well, because so many launches occur on Federal ranges.

150
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:49.250
Brian Rushforth: Specifically the Kate. So they have a huge hand. and

151
00:18:49.490 --> 00:19:00.540
Brian Rushforth: in and say in into the input of of what we do how we do. So we work very closely with them, you know. So, for example.

152
00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.570
Brian Rushforth:  the

153
00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:33.819
Brian Rushforth: Csvg acronym, because I keep going with Brian. The merged the emergency group all the time. The So there's common standards working group. Thank you. The common standards working group is an intergovernmental organization that gets together and meets very regularly between NASA the Faa and Dod to come up with standards on Federal ranges, and how we evaluate launches?

154
00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:53.440
Brian Rushforth: so that we are, you know we we are not siloed in making decisions that inadvertently affects you know, a, a a Federal range in the operations on Federal users, on by NASA or Dod, and vice versa. That's not NASA and Dod don't want to impose

155
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:58.919
Brian Rushforth: such restrictions that it inadvertently shuts down commercial operations

156
00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:02.900
Brian Rushforth: as well. So those those kinds of

157
00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:07.360
Brian Rushforth: you know. And you're gonna find that that kind of in any kind of regulatory

158
00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:19.050
Brian Rushforth: environment. Right? There's the people who are really, really knowledgeable about what you do, what? How you do it? the rules, because it really affects them.

159
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:25.660
Brian Rushforth:  and so there's, you know, there's a huge self interest in in knowing

160
00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:29.670
Brian Rushforth: But But again, unless

161
00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:36.290
Brian Rushforth: you know, we're not like the Faa, where, if you go fly! You're touching parts of the Faa like your traffic.

162
00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:43.890
Brian Rushforth: you know, or that the fact that everything you get on board and touch in a aircraft

163
00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:50.180
Brian Rushforth: has been certificated by the Faa to include the pilots. the mechanics.

164
00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:59.390
Brian Rushforth: the flight attendants, the manufacturers, the manufacturers of the parts, the schools that trained all these. They're all certificate.

165
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:05.500
Brian Rushforth: So the public touches to the point. Now there's almost, you know, there's an expectation.

166
00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:07.909
Brian Rushforth: you know. No one should die

167
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:11.640
Brian Rushforth: ever on a commercial flight in the United States, right?

168
00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.280
Brian Rushforth: And that's the result of

169
00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:19.050
Brian Rushforth: decades of regulations and working with the industry cooperatively

170
00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:28.870
Brian Rushforth: to come up with solutions to to safety problems. it's a different world. Most people don't flying space

171
00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:39.949
Brian Rushforth: on commercial things. Most most members of the public aren't doing this. I mean, they're watching the occasional watches. They're seeing the satellites of, you know the starlinks.

172
00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:45.519
you know, they're gonna see the stuff on, you know, going to the moon, and eventually to Mars

173
00:21:46.060 --> 00:22:03.400
Brian Rushforth: Space International Space Station. They, you know, they see those, but those are much more esoteric. Not not day to day and you know, tends not to. Really. Our our stuff really hasn't ended in any real disaster. We we expect a certain level of failure

174
00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:12.109
Brian Rushforth: but from the Faa's perspective, if a rocket fails but it fails in an area and in a manner we were expecting.

175
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:18.709
Brian Rushforth: then great. Everything worked according to plan cause. Now, if a 7, 37 fails.

176
00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:21.880
Brian Rushforth: everyone's all over it.

177
00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:30.749
Brian Rushforth: Everyone's all over that, because we've actually certificated that aircraft to be safe for flying for the flying public.

178
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:39.029
Brian Rushforth: We don't certificate launch of vehicles. We are just focused on that. The the flying part of the not involved public

179
00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:43.660
Brian Rushforth: is, is, in fact, safe from errant debris or or whatever

180
00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.879
Brian Verna: to carry that to the

181
00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:55.700
Brian Verna: folks that we share the building with the aviation folks. A lot of them don't know what we do in commercial space. which is.

182
00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:02.739
Brian Verna: it's shocking. But it's not because I came from the aviation side, and I didn't know what they did. Now I'm here.

183
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:05.630
Brian Verna: recently, or our

184
00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:10.719
Brian Verna: our associate administrator for commercial space transportation met with

185
00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.090
Brian Verna: European

186
00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.909
Brian Verna: counterparts. But their aviation counterparts and they thought.

187
00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:28.589
Brian Verna: doesn't NASA do that? So? Yes, to answer your question, Kaylee. The the companies that do business with us know us the best. They know what we're our mission is, they know what

188
00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:34.900
Brian Verna: what we do and how it affects them. Most members of the public don't even any aviation people

189
00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:53.119
Brian Verna: don't. And then, of course, the European side. They don't do as much launch, but they're trying to get there, Germany said. They want to start one have their first launch in the next year. So Spain is very interested. they're coming on board. There's only like 6 countries that regularly launch

190
00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.120
Brian Verna: so internationally.

191
00:23:55.550 --> 00:24:01.910
Brian Verna: I don't think we're known what we do. they probably just think it's oh, it's the space, it it's NASA.

192
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:03.819
Brian Verna: But yeah.

193
00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:09.629
Kaylee Swenson: yeah, And with your specific positions in

194
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:14.270
Kaylee Swenson: being in commercial space instead of just the faa

195
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:22.490
Kaylee Swenson: you deal with companies such as spacex blue origin, like you've mentioned, and in those times,

196
00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:45.330
Kaylee Swenson: the literature refers to them as like times of crisis. But in those times where things don't go as planned something fails in a way that was not quite expected, or it was worrisome. Do you feel like public opinion plays a role in how that is handled or moving forward? That public opinion isn't impacted by that at all.

197
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:56.329
Brian Rushforth: My my biggest fear is that because we are part of the Faa. and because the pop we have been so successful as an agency

198
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.790
Brian Rushforth: and safety aviation safety.

199
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.540
Brian Rushforth: that

200
00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:14.159
Brian Rushforth: when someone or a group of people dies on a. on a, on a, on some kind of launch vehicle, the Iss, or whatever

201
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:26.799
Brian Rushforth: the level of it, you know the the expectation will be we should regulate. So that doesn't have again. And the fact of the matter is is that we're kind of in a area of where

202
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:32.080
Brian Rushforth: you know, aviation was in, say, the twenties thirties, maybe.

203
00:25:32.440 --> 00:26:01.880
Brian Rushforth:  which didn't have nearly the level of regulation. And also, you know, had a level of risk along with just the you know, the the, you know, looking at my background. you know, we have had decades of regulations about survivability on board commercial aircraft, you know. We, you know, lighted lighted dial lights. you know, flamers were flame retardant materials on the

204
00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:16.210
Brian Rushforth: on the seats, a whole host of different survivability mechanisms. Because if you survive that crash. guess what you're probably going to survive. If you survive a mishap out in space.

205
00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:24.739
Brian Rushforth: there's no warm, breathable environment for you to go to. You're just simply going to die.

206
00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.239
Brian Rushforth: There's no rescue coming.

207
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:32.270
Brian Rushforth: despite what Armageddon and the other Hollywood movies have.

208
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:38.670
Brian Rushforth: there is. No, there's no rescue core of space rescue.

209
00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:47.270
Brian Rushforth: You're going to die. It's that simple and I don't think we're I I think we're public opinion plays.

210
00:26:47.440 --> 00:27:14.479
Brian Rushforth: is it? My my concern is is that when we get something and it, and especially if it's like a high profile, you know. I say, Richard Branson, or an Elon Musk, you know, dies, or someone some rich person or famous person dies. Well, guess what then? We're going to get a whole slew of statutes and laws that require us to do all these are rule making to prevent this, and it's like.

211
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.829
Brian Rushforth: you know we can. We can look at it. But

212
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:30.149
Brian Rushforth: you know I I don't know if we, if if you try to make space at this stage as safe as aviation. You're going to fail. You're going to chunk the industry.

213
00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:32.809
Brian Rushforth: It's it's a risky thing

214
00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.299
Brian Rushforth: your your

215
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:43.630
Brian Verna: it's not like getting on a Bwi, a southwest airlines flight somewhere. Urban engine safety has come a long way since the sixties.

216
00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.300
Brian Verna: and it's the safest

217
00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:52.710
Brian Verna: engine you can create. it's a lot different than riding on a controlled explosion. So

218
00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.850
Brian Verna: so I don't know how public opinion would.

219
00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.209
Brian Verna: We'd ever get to that point. But

220
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:17.019
Kaylee Swenson: yeah, with these more high profile people such as you and Musk there have been concerns in the past that when Spacex came under scrutiny for such as violating something within their licensing. The Elon musk

221
00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:37.569
Kaylee Swenson: would then turn and tweet about how the Faa was like too restrictive, and I think maybe like said that it was gonna be the reason that humanity never got to Mars very inflammatory language. Would you say that that does have an impact on public opinion from your perspective, or that it's kind of in solar and separate.

222
00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:46.660
Brian Rushforth: like, if you're talking to Elon Musk, he's gonna have an impact on public opinion, no matter what he says and what the public and the public opinion will be both good and bad.

223
00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:49.929
Brian Rushforth: at this stage of the game. not. You know.

224
00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.880
Brian Rushforth: billionaires have greater reach.

225
00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:59.829
Brian Rushforth: They they call the White House they call Congress. They call the Secretary. They call the Administrator.

226
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:02.790
that's just a fact.

227
00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:08.280
Brian Rushforth: that's just a fact. It's but it's no, it's different in scale.

228
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.330
Brian Rushforth: but it's not different in kind

229
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:22.090
Brian Rushforth: from what the aviation signed faces all the time there's an airport located. There's at least one airport located in every single professional district in the United States.

230
00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:27.090
Brian Rushforth: and that airport gets construction funds or has jobs or

231
00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:46.029
Brian Rushforth: has airlines, an airline service. And you know, there's lots of places that have. You know the Charlotte, the Dallas for worse, you know, Major, you know Atlanta with Delta, Major Hubs and major air carriers, and those Ceos are also very influential.

232
00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:55.409
Brian Rushforth: on stuff. So But in the end we're still, we still gotta do what we gotta do in terms of of public safety.

233
00:29:55.870 --> 00:30:04.040
Brian Rushforth: and you just have to be diplomatic about it. And so what you know. What you have to do as a regulator is, we have certain

234
00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:15.439
Brian Rushforth: rules, and we have certain processes, and where the government as a whole usually gets in trouble is what we don't follow our own stated processes.

235
00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.100
if we follow them.

236
00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:22.609
Brian Rushforth: you know, Congress always has the right to change.

237
00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:30.270
Brian Rushforth: change, change the race and change the processes. But we are obligated by law to follow

238
00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:34.869
Brian Rushforth: what is what is published and what is, has been accepted through

239
00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:38.549
Brian Rushforth: the Administrative Procedures Act or through statute.

240
00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.449
Brian Rushforth: I mean, that's just what we have to do.

241
00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:51.200
Brian Verna: I can't remember the the number of hits, but I think there was a back and forth between an fa previous official and Elon.

242
00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:56.790
Brian Verna: and it generated like 12,000 unique hits or something on our commercial space website which

243
00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:01.559
Brian Verna: it's an agency record, I think. and it will never be seen again.

244
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:11.819
Brian Verna: but hopefully. But if you look at that, I mean the Space company, CEO generating that much interest into what we do.

245
00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.429
Brian Verna: That didn't change much.

246
00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:17.880
Brian Verna: because, as Brian said, we stick to our processes.

247
00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:18.990
Brian Verna: the

248
00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:35.779
Brian Verna: that public opinion cannot change. It will not change how our our licensing evaluators evaluate their compliance to the regulations. or it doesn't change our safety regulations because it takes at least of a 5 year process following the Administrative Procedures Act if we wanted to.

249
00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:43.780
Brian Verna: So we can't just willingly change regs because someone thinks it's inconvenient. It' be arbitrary and capricious.

250
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:45.740
Brian Verna: correct. And

251
00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.070
Brian Verna: because someone wants to use

252
00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:58.559
Brian Verna: these big explosive rockets as a test platform to get what they want in the end, it doesn't mean they can skirt the safety regulations of protecting the UN. Involved public.

253
00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:02.380
Brian Verna: We're going to do that time and time again and follow our processes over and over again.

254
00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:05.459
Brian Verna: So I I think, like Brian said.

255
00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:08.240
Brian Verna: It generates a lot of interest, good and bad, but

256
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:17.120
Brian Verna: that public opinion can't. It doesn't change anything it might put some pressure on. but our top cover our our bosses all the way at the top.

257
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:23.710
Brian Verna: They will have our engineers backs or our our inspectors backs, 100%.

258
00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.969
Brian Verna: We're gonna do what we gotta do. We're gonna follow by the book and our process.

259
00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:29.390
Kaylee Swenson: Okay.

260
00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:42.270
Kaylee Swenson: changing gears a little bit. You mentioned towards the beginning that sometimes the Commercial Space Transportation Department will do like social media campaigns. what is the goal with those?

261
00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:53.749
Brian Rushforth: Well generate. So this is where Stevecom is probably better or or Brian But I'll give you one specific example

262
00:32:53.900 --> 00:33:06.949
Brian Rushforth: of of what we have done or 2 like 2 examples. So we typically generate, there's something on Twitter Facebook, the the Faa page that happens with launches. Or if there's something unique

263
00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:14.650
Brian Rushforth: like a first time launch from a new applicant or a new technology, a new launch vehicle.

264
00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:19.230
Brian Rushforth: you know. We'll we'll put out stuff and we'll work with not only

265
00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:31.620
Brian Rushforth: or you know, the Communications Department, but also the communications and Pr folks of the launch operators as well. So we're not inadvertently crossing past because we are

266
00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.980
Brian Rushforth: you know it is an exciting

267
00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:37.810
Brian Rushforth: huh! There we go.

268
00:33:38.000 --> 00:34:07.720
Brian Rushforth: there you go, general public awareness. We also have done stuff on stem for for items. So, for example, we participated with the intergovernmental effort from the White House to do a huge stem, you know I see myself in space, a space stem, specific initial place and space. Your place in space kind of okay. I forget that

269
00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:25.290
Brian Rushforth: we were tiny in terms of what we contributed. I mean, we had Department of education. We had NASA, we had National Science Foundation, we have Smithsonian Dod, I mean, with contributing stuff. But we participated.

270
00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:37.330
Brian Rushforth: and among that participation was a Pr. was a coronated campaign with Twitter and Facebook and and all that with standard Logos. And

271
00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:47.919
Brian Rushforth: you know, hashtags and and that kind of stuff. And that generated, I I have Steve's email on the results of that in terms of the hits and the metrics.

272
00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:52.269
Brian Rushforth: that I could probably forward at some point as to what it was. But you know.

273
00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.520
Brian Rushforth: that's that's in a nutshell.

274
00:34:54.949 --> 00:34:56.340
Brian Rushforth: Yeah, thank you.

275
00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:00.229
Kaylee Swenson: Did you have anything to?

276
00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:11.779
Brian Verna: Well, I know we we participated in that the American rocketry challenge. but we did take some

277
00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:21.190
Brian Verna: photos. And one of the photos we did. We used it for our new homepage. So when we do do social, we always link our homepage

278
00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:28.599
Brian Verna: because we want to draw hits and interest there. So we post a lot about jobs.

279
00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:34.999
Brian Verna: I guess we're not under a huge hiring campaign right now, and we've got 28

280
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:42.530
Brian Verna: positions left to fill by the end of the fiscal year. So as those positions become available to the public, we're going to post social

281
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:54.239
Brian Verna: because we got to drive people, the best engineers to this. the job posting is put in for them, and we do that through social as well. Linkedin Twitter, Facebook.

282
00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:58.569
Brian Verna: Instagram. And I said, Twitter, I,

283
00:35:58.610 --> 00:35:59.640
Brian Verna: So

284
00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:04.860
Brian Verna: again, we we tag our website.

285
00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:13.729
Brian Verna: And then this, this recent American rocketry challenge, we have a picture on our website there. And it links to our stem efforts on our web page. So.

286
00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:24.939
Kaylee Swenson: yeah, when either your department specifically or the Faa largely is doing those stem pushes and those kind of

287
00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:37.350
Kaylee Swenson: efforts to engage a younger public and garner interest in future careers. Would you say that there is an effort to engage certain demographics? Or is it just kind of blanketed

288
00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:46.410
Kaylee Swenson: like increasing diversity? Or

289
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:55.960
Brian Rushforth: well, there's different kinds. So like your place in space was was targeted at traditionally

290
00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:59.679
Brian Rushforth:  under represented areas for step

291
00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:03.389
Brian Rushforth: So we will also

292
00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:08.619
Brian Rushforth: but on on things like the American rocketry challenge, the demographic is

293
00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:12.919
Brian Rushforth: kids who are super interested in super competitive about

294
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:15.909
Brian Rushforth: rockets and model rockets, anyway.

295
00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:29.800
Brian Rushforth: and we'll have a table out at at the event with other faa folks and volunteers and that kind of stuff. So some of it's going where the events are happening. I think there's

296
00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:44.149
Brian Rushforth: there's this spaceport America Cup, or something like that in a month or so, or relatively soon. That's an up, you know. We we operate a table out there.

297
00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:46.929
there's

298
00:37:47.130 --> 00:38:00.439
Brian Rushforth: we' we're currently working, for example, with a Morgan State University, a, you know, historic Black college university to evaluate whether or not we're we are going to support some

299
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:08.160
Brian Rushforth: logistical, you know. Get some money for the for NASA to do, some to pay for NASA, do some flight system

300
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:15.800
Brian Rushforth: safety analyses for out of wallops for an experimental rocket. that a team is putting together.

301
00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.539
So there is a

302
00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:22.820
Brian Rushforth: you know, there's traditionally been an emphasis on looking at

303
00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:26.840
Brian Rushforth: minorities. Women

304
00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:31.209
Brian Rushforth: other, you know, inner, you know, more inner cities or urban

305
00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:35.110
Brian Rushforth: areas. and

306
00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:49.809
Brian Rushforth: but there's also just a general. But all this stuff especially around the your place in space is publicly available to anyone. to any. I mean, we have. There's a if you go to your place in space and their public stuff. They got all kinds of teacher

307
00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:51.210
Brian Rushforth: materials.

308
00:38:51.360 --> 00:39:04.260
Brian Rushforth: So even though it's quote, targeted, it's available to anybody. And that's why you know, the whole point is that yes, you know, you see the astronauts, and you see the vast majority, or

309
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:10.359
Brian Rushforth: or white, male or whatever. But you also are seeing more women. Now you're seeing people of color, you're seeing.

310
00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:16.839
Brian Rushforth: you know. So it you know the you have the girls? you know. Yeah, you can be smart math, or whatever.

311
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:19.340
Kaylee Swenson: Yeah.

312
00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.390
Kaylee Swenson: I had a question that was going to follow up on that.

313
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:38.649
Kaylee Swenson: and I lost it. Oh. do you feel like amongst the public? Different demographics might vary in their public opinion of either your department or the agency as a whole like, do you feel like that varies?

314
00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:55.019
Brian Rushforth: That's an interesting question. Because I don't know. I mean demographics. That's not something that stands out without actually looking at the data

315
00:39:55.380 --> 00:40:06.079
Brian Rushforth: most most kids are not concerned about. you know. Is this NASA, or is this the office of commercial space transportation under the Faa, which is also in the Department of Transportation.

316
00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:14.509
Brian Rushforth: No. One, I mean my own kids. I've worked in the fa since 2,001. My own kids, eyes plays over, and they're adult stuff

317
00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:18.669
Brian Rushforth: stuff. So I'm I'm not sure we're just

318
00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:25.280
Brian Rushforth: even thought of. It's just what's what's thought of as positive is the activity.

319
00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:30.650
Brian Rushforth: It's it's launches. it's new technologies.

320
00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:35.200
Brian Rushforth: It's people participating in really cool things happening

321
00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:49.209
Brian Rushforth: that I think has a positive thing. But as for our individual organization, and you know whether there's whether even people have an opinion per se in the general public. I'm I'm a little skeptical.

322
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:52.910
Brian Verna: I, personally haven't seen any

323
00:40:53.080 --> 00:41:00.450
Brian Verna: break down demographically, how would they view space in general, let alone our agency in space?

324
00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:13.800
Kaylee Swenson: Okay. So there are some efforts to engage under represented groups, but not necessarily because the public opinion from most groups is any different, just because of an increase in diversity in the workforce.

325
00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:27.170
Brian Rushforth: not just increase in diversity. Well, it's it's not okay. So this is a big Dia stuff. It is not about increasing diversity in the workforce. It's about getting the best workforce we can. And filling

326
00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:34.650
Brian Rushforth: that workforce there is a huge gap. We're going to have an engineers in the future. It's not merely about

327
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:44.109
Brian Rushforth: diversity for diversity sake it is about is about filling gaps that we know is going to happen in order to keep American companies competitive.

328
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:57.020
Kaylee Swenson: Yeah, I have heard that now is one of the best times to start working for the government, because an entire generation is starting to retire. So there's a lot more open positions.

329
00:41:57.570 --> 00:42:02.390
Brian Rushforth: We're we're hoping to get to a hundred 50 by the end of the fiscal year. So we're not.

330
00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:13.569
Brian Verna: We are not the organization driving employment to to piggyback on the employment piece. So there's the stem efforts.

331
00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:24.250
Brian Verna: So, talking to a gentleman who works for Brian. That is our stem lead, he he acknowledges when you're talking to high school kids, it's too late. College because it's too like

332
00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:37.590
Brian Verna: they're already on a path, or they're not interested. but it's a middle school and earlier. So we've got to figure out better ways to do that. But going to the employment piece, we have many

333
00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:44.639
Brian Verna: known minority serving institutions internships.

334
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:48.400
Brian Verna: pipelines, if you will, to our our group.

335
00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:59.489
Brian Verna: So there's the I applied for one for this summer, and unfortunately did not get it. So now I'm focusing on interviews.

336
00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:09.950
Brian Verna: Yeah, I figured they might have just not known what to do with someone at my level. That's fine. There's the brook Owens fellowship

337
00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:11.210
Brian Verna: for women.

338
00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:15.590
Brian Verna: And we have one of those fellows

339
00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.720
Brian Verna: working for us right now.

340
00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:26.580
Brian Verna: We have. Oh, gee! What's the other one. There's there's a zag. There's the first class of 16

341
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:31.950
Brian Verna: kids. They're all It's minority and

342
00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:51.909
Brian Verna: focus. So there's 16 of those candidate our fellows that are graduating from this fellow, this the zag. I think it's through Naka National Air Cares Association like they're sponsoring it. But, Zag, I think it's Eeg This is the first class, I think 2,023. So

343
00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:54.829
Brian Verna: there's 16 there, there's

344
00:43:55.870 --> 00:44:15.059
Brian Verna: there's quite a few intern. Just because when I worked in the aviation side of the fa, I didn't see that much internship stuff going on. But then I come to a group of 100 people where I came from a group of 8,000 people. I go to a group of 100 people, and they have all these interns, and it's great like they're

345
00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:21.109
Brian Verna: getting these kids new ideas, giving them stuff to do. So there's a ton of work in in our area.

346
00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:24.530
Brian Verna: so there's no setting on your hands. But you know, I think there's

347
00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:29.279
Brian Verna: the the employment piece, the pipelines we're building those, and those are getting pretty strong

348
00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:30.390
Brian Verna: over here.

349
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:32.350
Kaylee Swenson: Yeah.

350
00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:40.240
Brian Rushforth: So, Kaylee, I'm just. I need to do a time check because I do have a hard stop at 3. But I am more than happy

351
00:44:40.270 --> 00:45:05.410
Brian Rushforth: schedule another time to continue. But I just want to give you a you know, a a heads up more than a minute out. that that I'm unfortunately going to have to to drop off. Okay, then I I've gotten most of my need. My last couple of questions is, is there anything I've not asked that you think would accurately or better describe the relationship between your department or agency with the public.

352
00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:07.919
Kaylee Swenson: Anything that we haven't talked about.

353
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:14.959
Brian Rushforth: It's okay, if that's a no. I worked very hard on the questions to try to ask everything.

354
00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:22.429
Brian Rushforth: So interactions with the public tend to be

355
00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:28.160
Brian Rushforth:  either through the applications, you know, and dealing with.

356
00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:32.129
Brian Rushforth: you know, the people that are the corporations are applying

357
00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:42.330
Brian Rushforth: but in terms of public public it's it's quite frankly been a lot of neat but related, I mean, that was my experience when I was chief of staff at 1 point

358
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:58.850
Brian Rushforth: all my interactions with the public in general was around environmental stuff and decisions we were making as to whether or not to approve a spaceport license or a particular launch license, or any of that. So like a lot of like a lot of regulatory

359
00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:05.730
Brian Rushforth: areas in the government and the public. it naturally lends to conflict.

360
00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:07.360
When you're talking.

361
00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:18.900
Brian Rushforth: build it. Don't build it permitted. but that's a you know, that's an issue that's not unique in any way, shape or form to us.

362
00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:22.619
Brian Rushforth: it's it's it's endemic across

363
00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:24.479
the Federal Government.

364
00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:28.459
Brian Rushforth: but that's where I where I see the public. That's why I see it most.

365
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:32.110
Brian Rushforth: I mean when you know we had. you know.

366
00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:44.709
Brian Rushforth: the first manned commercial launch? No one said, Wow, faa. no, it was great jobs. Spacex. Great job, NASA.

367
00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:46.059
Brian Rushforth: You know

368
00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.580
Brian Rushforth: it's it's not.

369
00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:59.210
Brian Rushforth: It's not us, I mean the other. The other area, quite frankly, which isn't even our area is, you know, you have to clear out your space. That's your traffic control organization.

370
00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:04.790
Brian Rushforth: Well, airlines don't like having hazard areas that they can't fly through

371
00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:09.429
Brian Rushforth: and they have to go around, and so that generates conflict.

372
00:47:10.690 --> 00:47:15.850
Brian Rushforth: So most most interactions with the public

373
00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:22.880
Brian Rushforth: and the Federal government from a federal government workers perspective in my years here are. Rarely.

374
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:30.179
Brian Rushforth: rarely do I get any calls to say, Hi, I just want to let you know what a great job you're doing.

375
00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:36.979
Brian Rushforth: If I'm getting a call from the public. It's because there is a problem.

376
00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:47.520
Brian Rushforth: or they believe there is a problem, and they think I can fix it. And it's your problem. And it goes my problem. But it's not. It's not about.

377
00:47:49.120 --> 00:48:05.269
Brian Rushforth: you know. Oh, we're we're really changing positive, you know, we're influencing public opinion. It's just that's the nature of the reality of being in a regulator, and in and in dealing with with the public and and with what our authorities have, and trying to educate them

378
00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:13.189
Brian Rushforth: on what our authorities are and what they are. I was in. I was on the aviation side, too, and I was. I was a regulator for the airport.

379
00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:28.770
Brian Rushforth: and I would regularly get random calls from the public. I don't know why the switchboards gave them to me, but we need to remove the aluminum cans off of planes. Because the terrorists with superhuman strength. They're going to rip them apart and cut everyone's throat.

380
00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:38.779
Brian Rushforth:  you know. Why? Is my son's airplane on the tarmac in Boston when he's got a connecting flight to Australia. And La is going to miss

381
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:53.299
Kaylee Swenson: yeah stuff that you personally are not going to be able to.

382
00:48:54.540 --> 00:49:08.420
Brian Rushforth: So it's it's it's you don't become a regulator to. If if you really have a burning need to get positive affirmation from from strangers.

383
00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:18.520
Kaylee Swenson: And then my last question is, just, is there anyone else you would recommend that I talk to about these types of topics?

384
00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:34.389
Brian Rushforth: Steve? So Brian gave a you know, a really nice general thing from Steve. But if you really want to get into the Pr. Piece, and you know how the Faa as a whole, and what as T as a commercial space

385
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:44.379
Brian Rushforth: as a whole does in terms of a generic public outreach. You're, you know, using the metrics and using all this other stuff. He's probably the guy

386
00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:48.800
Brian Rushforth: you want to talk to. as a communications professional.

387
00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:49.750
Kaylee Swenson: Okay?

388
00:49:50.320 --> 00:50:00.420
Kaylee Swenson: Okay? And then, Mr. Grant. Is it okay? If I reach out to him directly, I want to ask your permission for us, because you're the reason that I even know he exists, so I don't want to go around you and

389
00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:03.250
Kaylee Swenson: harass him, or anything about an interview.

390
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:11.799
Brian Verna: he I don't. I think he just kind of wanted to decline. And he just wanted to sum up his comments with that basic

391
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:14.500
Brian Verna: statement.

392
00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:22.789
Kaylee Swenson: well, I've definitely gotten a lot of information from you guys. and it's been a great insight into what it looks like to

393
00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:32.809
Kaylee Swenson: be in this specific department and under the shadow of NASA and alongside the Faa, and there perfect pristine standard of safety

394
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:41.670
Brian Rushforth: let me give you. Here's another thing that just just in terms of setting the stage. NASA has its own studio.

395
00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:49.640
Brian Rushforth: Yeah, they have their own TV channel

396
00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:52.190
Brian Rushforth: and Pr.

397
00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:55.719
Brian Rushforth: and why wouldn't they?

398
00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:58.970
Brian Rushforth: My, when they they they're the good news people.

399
00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:15.379
Brian Rushforth: right? If the Faa gets involved in something, or you know, it's it's typically we're putting regulations out or restricting, or you know. But it's it's not usually, or something crashed, or whatever

400
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:19.779
Brian Rushforth: you know. But, NASA, you know NASA's.

401
00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:31.259
Brian Rushforth: you know, kudos to them. They know what they're doing in terms of Pr, and they're there's they're not regulated their explorers. They're they. They push the envelope for stuff. They do really cool things.

402
00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:38.889
Brian Rushforth: Yeah, would you say that difference is primarily because you guys are regulation versus NASA's more exploratory

403
00:51:39.210 --> 00:51:41.100
Brian Rushforth: and more. They're more visible.

404
00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:56.119
Brian Rushforth: I I mean, you don't get a lot of news. You get her newspaper articles around Cassini, around voyager around the Mars Rover. Oh, look what the Mars were over there! Oh, here's a new Hubble telescope thing, isn't it gorgeous?

405
00:51:56.180 --> 00:52:03.289
Brian Rushforth: And so every time there's a new picture, or some new thing. It hits the newspapers. You don't get that. Well.

406
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.250
Brian Rushforth: we approve 4 licenses

407
00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:13.080
Brian Rushforth: and issued letters, so, allowing them to do operations. That's not sexy.

408
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:22.330
Brian Rushforth: It's absolutely required from a safety perspective. But it's not sexy. And it's not something that lends itself to. Wow. We should really put out a press release.

409
00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:23.320
Kaylee Swenson: you know.

410
00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:31.020
Kaylee Swenson: Okay, well, thank you so much. I know that we're running out of time to either. Do you have any questions for me?

411
00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:55.109
Kaylee Swenson: Yeah, thank you so much for your time. If at any point you have any questions relating to what I'm going to be doing with this information, or how it's moving forward. Please feel free to email me and if I ever publish anything using your name or a quote from you, I'll make sure to send it to you before it is published, so that you can at that point retract your consent if you so, if

412
00:52:55.230 --> 00:53:00.030
Brian Rushforth: we appreciate that as a person who is who's

413
00:53:00.730 --> 00:53:22.169
Kaylee Swenson: Had 2 separate emails spliced together into one quote on 2 separate topics. So by by a member of the press, I I appreciate that. Yeah. Now, in Academia we're striving for accuracy. Not as much the flashy expose type. So okay, thank you both so much for your time. Thank you so much. Bye, bye.
